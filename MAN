./partanalyze aims at being a general program for analyzing (sets of) partitions.
 Here a partition is defined as in set theory of mathematics (see      
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set). It also allows to   
 edit (rudimentarily), as well as generate, partitions.                
                                                                       
Examples:
For lastest options check the help from the program
./partanalyze -h

Check consistency of a given partition test.subfam.lst based on a matrix of interactions given by test-blast_pairwise_id.
How large are the intra-cluster values compared to the inter-cluster ones.
./partanalyze -c test-blast_pairwise_id test.subfam.lst
or
./partanalyze --check-consistency-of-partition test-blast_pairwise_id test.subfam.lst
which also accepts an abreviated form as
./partanalyze --ccop test-blast_pairwise_id test.subfam.lst

Calculate VI distance between two partitions and between each of them and their intersection
 Definition of VI distance: Given two partitions P1 and P2, with cluster size distributions
 {n_k} and {n_k'} respectively, where k and k' are indexes to each of their corresponding clusters, and 
 such that Sum_k n_k = Sum_k n'_k = N, the VI distance is defined as
 
	VI (P1,P2)  = Sum_k n_k/N * log( n_k/N) + Sum_k' n_k'/N * log( n_k'/N) - 2 * Sum_k Sum_k' n_kk'/N log(n_kk'/N)
 where  n_kk' is the number of items common to cluster k of P1 and cluster k' of P2.
 This definition satisfies the triangular inequality, i.e., for any three partitions P1,P2 and P, it is
 	VI (P1, P) + VI (P,P2) >= VI (P1,P2)
./partanalyze --vi-distance test.subfam.lst test.subfam.lst2
or simply
./partanalyze -v test.subfam.lst test.subfam.lst2

Print the intersection of 2 partitions test.subfam.lst and test.subfam.lst2
./partanalyze -i test.subfam.lst test.subfam.lst2
Performs the intersection of P1 and P2 as induced by the intersection operation on
 the underlying set (the one that contains all elements). This gives a new partition
 I such that each cluster of I is obtained as an intersection of one cluster of P1 and
 one of P2 (all againts all).

Print the purity scores for partition1 (target) againts partition2 (reference)
./partanalyze --purity-scores test.subfam.lst test.subfam.lst2
or simplply
./partanalyze -p test.subfam.lst test.subfam.lst2

It outputs the purity strict and purity lax values. 
Purity strict of P1 againts P2 := the number of non-singleton clusters of P1 that
 are exactly identical to one of P2, divided by the number of non-singleton clusters
 of P2 (the reference).
Purity Lax of P1 againts P2 := the number of non-singleton clusters of P1 that
 are subsets of a cluster of P2, divided by the number of non-singleton clusters
 of P1 (the target).

For debugging: print the interaction matrix read by the program
./partanalyze --print-matrix test-blast_pairwise_id

partanalyzer aims at being a general program for analyzing (sets of) partitions.
 Here a partition is defined as in set theory of mathematics (see

 Whenever many input files are expected, one can either list them as   
 command line arguments, or list them in a file and use option -f to   
 specify that file.                                                    
                                                                       
 For calculating distances between partitions with different number of 
 elements, use option --DIST_SUBSPROJECT right before any *stat command.
 Works only with a *stat distance command, i.e., not  purity scores.

          For each item, determines the most frequent cluster where    
          it appears among all the clusters of all the given partitions.

          reference partition (the first). Possible values are for     
          the overlap are:                                             
          -over fraction elements in common relative to the target cluster.

          It outputs:                                                  
          -Confusion matrix (in % of the target clusters) taking       
            the first partition as reference and the second as target. 
          -number of overlaps for each target cluster                  
          -Split-Merge image showing the CT. In addition it show two   
		   reference color bars: a bottom color bar representing the  
            perfect split transformations (black), the merge-only      
            (white) ones and those cases in between (different grey    
            levels); a right-most column shows whether these are perfect
            matches (black) or not (white).                            
                                                                       
       -I , --info , {--isPart , --isaPart , --is-partition} [-ofs ofs]
           For each partition checks whether it is a sound partition   
           or not, i.e., whether all of its clusters are pair-wise     
           disjoint. With option -q, only error message will be printed
           in case partition is not sound, otherwise it'll keep silent.

       --part-extract-elements {--extract-elements} elements_file      
           elements_file lists the names of the elements to cull from  
           the given partition                                         
                                                                       
For converting between different partition formats                     
                                                                       
       --toMCL [-tab mcl_tab_file] converts partition from PART format  
           to MCL's format. If additional tab file is provided, output 
           will contain the specific label index given in the tab file.
                                                                       
       --toFREE converts partition from PART format to FREE format.     
                                                                       
       --MCLtoPART [-tab mcl_tabl_file]                                 
           converts partition from MCL format to PART format.          
           If additional tab file is provided, output will contain     
           items' labels, instead of simply their MCL index number.    
                                                                       
For dealing with (fasta) sequence files                                
       --drop-clone-sequences                                          
       --msa-noclone-sequences                                         
       --seq-noclone-sequences sequence_file (fasta)                   
          Given a (fasta) sequence file or a fasta MSA file, remove all
          duplicate sequences. Here duplicate means literally that,    
          namely, exactly the same string of characters. Therefore, it 
          is not the same as having a pid=100%, but more stringent.    
          If a second sequence file is provided, drop also sequences   
          that are clones of any sequence in the second file.          
                                                                       
For analyzing Multiple Sequence Alignments                             
                                                                       
       --msa-seqid-stat                                                
       --msa-seqid-stat [--positions file]                             
          Given a multiple sequence alignment in fasta format, it      
          prints all pair-wise sequence identities. By default, it     
          calculates identities over the full sequence length. The     
          second version allows to specify the (reduced) set of positions
          we want to consider in comparing sequences. These should be  
          specified in a file, each separated by space,tabs, new lines,
          etc. The positions are understood as columns of the MSA.     
          If two MSA are provided, it prints the sequence Id of the    
          first set against the second.                                
                                                                       
       --msa-seqid-avg [-thr threshold ]                               
          Similar as option --msa-seqid-avg, but prints for each sequence
          a statistics of its pair-wise sequence identity to all other 
          sequences. This consists of average Seq.Id, standard         
          deviation, variance, minimum Seq.Id, maximum Seq.Id, number  
          of pairs with Seq.Id > threshold, fraction of pairs with Seq.
          Id. > threshold and total number of pairs.                   
          Option -thr allows to provide a specific threshold to use.   
                      default value is 50%. Values are floating numbers
                      within [0,100].                                  
          If two MSA are provided, it prints the sequence Id of the    
          first set against the second.                                
                                                                       
       --msa-extract-positions positions_file msa_file                 
          From the given MSA, extract only columns specified in file   
          positions_file.                                              
                                                                       
       --msa-extract-sequences sequences_file msa_file                 
       --msa-drop-sequences sequences_file msa_file                    
          From the given MSA, extract only sequences specified in file 
          sequences_file. This file contains a list of sequences names 
          The second form drops those sequences instead.               
          If a positions file is given, sequence Id's are calculated   
          considering only those columns of the MSA.                   
                                                                       
       --msa-extract-sequences-by-id msa_file1 msa_file2 [minId maxId] 
       --msa-drop-sequences-by-id sequences_file msa_file [minId maxId]
          From MSA msa_file1, extract sequences with an ID above minId 
          and at most maxId against any sequence of MSA msa_file2.     
          The second form drops those sequences instead. Default values
          values are minId=30 and maxId=100, i.e., homologous sequences.
          If a positions file is given, sequence Id's are calculated   
          considering only those columns of the MSA. In this case minId
          and maxId are mandatory and must come before positions_file. 
                                                                       
       --msa-extract-sequences-by-topid msa_file1 msa_file2 [count]    
       --msa-drop-sequences-by-topid sequences_file msa_file [count]   
          From MSA msa_file1, extract at most count most similar sequences 
          (seq.ID) to any sequence of MSA msa_file2.                   
          The second form drops those sequences instead.               
          If a positions file is given, sequence Id's are calculated   
          considering only those columns of the MSA. In this case count
          is mandatory and must come before positions_file.            
                                                                       
       --msa-redundant [-nsam nsam] [-nseq nseq] [-seed seed]          
          Duplicates sequences chosen at random in the given multiple  
          sequence alignment. Wtihout options, only one is chosen.     
          Option -nsam  Generate nsam samples of MSAs with nseq dupli- 
                        cated sequences. Each sample is written is its 
                        own directory.                                 
                 -nseq  Specify the number of sequences to duplicate.  
                 -seed  Specify the seed of the random number generator
          All options are expected to be integer values. The value of  
          the seed is written within .seed_used allowing for repeated  
          experiments.                                                 
                                                                       
       --print-msa                                                     
          Prints the given multiple sequence alignment. Useful for     
          debugging.

          deviation, standard error, skewness, minimum edge value,     
          max edge value and sample size (number of edges).            
          If a partition is provided, it also prints the cluster size  
          and cluster name each node belongs to.

          where float1, float2 are the matrix values of matrix1 and    
          matrix2, respectively. Both matrices are expected to contain 
          the same set of pair of items, i.e., the same set of edges.

          as option -m, but in addition includes the name of the   
          cluster each pair of values belong to. If they belong to     
          different clusters the label is "x". The label is NAN  
          if any of the item does not belong to any of the clusters
